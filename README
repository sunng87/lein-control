# lein-control

A leiningen plugin for clojure-control.
(https://github.com/killme2008/clojure-control).

## Usage

Include the plugin in your project.clj

    (defproject YOUR-PROJECT-NAME "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
        :dev-dependencies [[lein-control "0.1.0"]])

Generate a sample control file with:

    lein control init

There will be a `control.clj` in your project home.

To define a custom control file, you have to specify the path to it in 
your project.clj

    :control {:control-file "YOUR-FILE-NAME"}

You can also find a sample control file in clojure-control project.
But there are some differences for lein-control:

* you don't have to add any (ns) (require) for lein-control
* you SHOULD NOT add (begin) in this file, lein-control will add it for you.

Now, you can run your task with:

    lein control run your-cluster your-task [args...]
